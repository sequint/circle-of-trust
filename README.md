# The Circle of Trust Game

This is a fun game, inspired by my girlfriend's parents insisting that I do multiple tasks to get into the circle of trust.
The goal of the game is to complete a series of tasks to get into the inner most circle.
But! There are obstacles along the way that decrease your 'Stamina' points.
